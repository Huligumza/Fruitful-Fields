README for my website




 I began with the basic structure - making five different pages that all connect together. The home page welcomes visitors, the about page tells the business story, the products page shows what they sell, and then I made both a contact page and a special enquiry page for different types of customer questions.

 I used CSS to make everything look clean and professional, with greens and oranges that make you think of fresh fruits. I learned how to make the website look good on both computers and phones by using flexible layouts that adjust automatically. I also added some cool animations that make buttons move slightly when you hover over them and pages fade in when they load - little touches that make the site feel more alive.

The products page was probably the most challenging . I figured out how to create a shopping cart that actually remembers what you put in it, even if you leave the page and come back later. I used JavaScript to make the products filter when you type in the search box, and I added a nice feature where you can click on any fruit picture to see it bigger in a lightbox view. It took some trial and error to get the quantity buttons working properly, but now you can easily increase or decrease how much of each fruit you want to order.

For the contact forms, I wanted to make sure people couldn't submit forms with mistakes. I added validation that checks your email format as you type and makes sure you've filled in all the required fields. The enquiry form is smart too - it gives different responses based on what type of enquiry you select, like bulk orders or volunteering opportunities.

The map was easier than I expected! I used a free mapping library called Leaflet.js and just followed their documentation to add an interactive map showing where the business is located in Limpopo. It was pretty cool to see it working with just a few lines of code.
